## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Google and Apple Social Auth Setup

1. Fill provider secrets in:
   - `.envs/.local/.django` for local Docker/dev
   - `.envs/.production/.django` for production
2. Ensure your OAuth callback URLs are configured at each provider:
   - `https://<domain>/accounts/google/login/callback/`
   - `https://<domain>/accounts/apple/login/callback/`
3. Run migrations and sync allauth `SocialApp` records:

      uv run python manage.py migrate
      uv run python manage.py sync_social_apps

4. Verify in Django admin:
   - Open `/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/`
   - Confirm one `Google` app and one `Apple` app
   - Confirm each app is attached to the active `Site` (`SITE_ID=1` by default)

If you change credentials, rerun:

    uv run python manage.py sync_social_apps

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    uv run mypy todo_lisp

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    uv run coverage run -m pytest
    uv run coverage html
    uv run open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    uv run pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally.html#using-webpack-or-gulp).

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailpit will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With Mailpit running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.

### Docker
